## SSW 345 Node Lab Results

Summary: This lab was a great first step in understanding the Node.js environment. Since I don't have experience in web programming or JavaScript, this was really informative and the instructions were very detailed. Will definitely circle back to this lab once again in order to understand this a bit deeper in the future.
